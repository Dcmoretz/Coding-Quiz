# Coding-Quiz
For this project it took some hints and help from the code and examples shown here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k

For this quiz I wanted to do something a little different and ensure that it stuck out more than just plain questions and answers. This was to make it as interactive and enjoyable for the user experience as possible. 
I have the intent of writing a total of 5-10 questions that can be randomly selected and presented to the user so there is a different experience each quiz
